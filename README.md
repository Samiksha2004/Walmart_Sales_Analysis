## 🛠️ Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Preparation

* Retrieved dataset via Kaggle API
* Inspected schema, cleaned duplicates, handled missing values
* Parsed price fields and corrected data types
* Created `total` column = `unit_price × quantity`

### 2. Database Integration

* Connected Python to **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** using SQLAlchemy
* Created target tables and pushed cleaned data into both databases
* Validated database inserts via sample queries

### 3. Business Analysis via SQL

Executed well-structured SQL queries to analyze:

* Most frequent payment methods
* Revenue and sales by product categories
* Branch-wise and city-level performance
* Trends in customer quantity and transaction patterns

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* E-wallets had the highest transaction count
* Specific categories consistently outperformed others in revenue
* Certain cities showed strong, repeatable buying patterns
* Created a reliable analytical pipeline from raw data to decision-ready insights

---

## 🚀 Potential Enhancements

* Integrate a visualization layer using Power BI or Tableau
* Automate pipeline for real-time data ingestion
* Combine with external datasets for deeper customer segmentation
